CSC 4610 Website Overview:
1) Public IP URL: http://54.201.229.49/FirstServlet3/Home_Page.html
2) Register yourself on the website by clicking the registration tab
3) after filling out the info the signup servlet handles the request and inserts the feilds into the DB
4) Login after registering hit the back button to go home then hit the login tab
5) Enter your name and password which gets processed in the loginconf servlet checking to see if your details are stored in DB and also setting session attriubutes
6) after loging in you will be forward to the profile servlet also done by the loginconf servlet.
7) In the profile servlet you wil be able to see your name, email, password as stored in the DB aswell as edit your profile details or logout
8) Hitting the edit profile button brings you to the edit form which allows you to change your name, email, password. After submiting the edit the update servlet handles the update behind the scenes into the DB it dosent make a new entry but rather updates the old one. After the update you are forwarded back into the profile servlet to see the changes.
9) logging out use the logout servlet which terminates your session and forwards you back to the home page
10) Hitting the fishing tab brings you to the fishing servlet which holds all my photos from a recent fishing trip. From here registered users can comment on the post. Comments are loaded dynamically here no need to refresh the page. This is handled by my ajaxRequestPage servlet which makes sure that the commenter is in the DB and fetches their name,email,topic,comment. These entries are populated dynamically back onto the fishing servlet.
11) Few things to note behind the scenes a DB servelet to help establish connection in different servlets. Protecting against non registered users from posting comments or accesing the profile page will end or redirected you to login page
